	abstract = {This research note presents a new methodology to identify
motor vehicle crashes on Native American reservations by
using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) special jurisdiction element and the derived Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) element from the geospatial software. In 2016
there were 380 motor vehicle fatalities that occurred on
Native American reservations based on this new methodology, as compared to 298 fatalities reported in FARS and 321
fatalities identified from BIA.},
